We investigate the factor-criticality of G1⊠ G2 and obtain the following. Let G1 and G2 be connected m-factor-critical and n-factor-critical graphs, respectively.

62,2012.0,Benjamin Lévêque,"Universite Montpellier 2, France",2055,DISCRETE & COMPUTATIONAL GEOMETRY,1776135," A contact representation by triangles of a graph is a set of triangles in the plane such that two triangles intersect on at most one point, each triangle represents a vertex of the graph and two triangles intersects if and only if their corresponding vertices are adjacent. De Fraysseix, Ossona de Mendez and Rosenstiehl proved that every planar graph admits a contact representation by triangles. We strengthen this in terms of a simultaneous contact representation by triangles of a planar map and of its dual. A primal–dual contact representation by triangles of a planar map is a contact representation by triangles of the primal and a contact representation by triangles of the dual such that for every edge uv, bordering faces f and g, the intersection between the triangles corresponding to u and v is the same point as the intersection between the triangles corresponding to f and g. We prove that every 3-connected planar map admits a primal–dual contact representation by triangles. Moreover, the interiors of the triangles form a tiling of the triangle corresponding to the outer face and each contact point is a corner of exactly three triangles. Then we show that these representations are in one-to-one correspondence with generalized Schnyder woods defined by Felsner for 3-connected planar maps."

Actual mission design is a complex, multi-disciplinary and multi-objective activity with relevant economic implications. In this paper we will consider some simplified models proposed by the European Space Agency as test problems for global optimization (GTOP database). We show that many trajectory optimization problems can be quite efficiently solved by means of relatively simple global optimization techniques relying on standard methods for local optimization. We show in this paper that our approach has been able to find trajectories which in many cases outperform those already known. We also conjecture that this problem displays a ""funnel structure"" similar, in some sense, to that of molecular optimization problems."

In the first problem, we are given prescribed vertex subsets and the problem asks for finding the best location of roots of arc-disjoint arborescences that span these vertex subsets. We show that this problem is NP-hard in general and that it can be solved in polynomial time in the case where the prescribed vertex subsets are convex. In the second problem, we are given a demand d(v) for each vertex v and the problem asks for finding the best location of roots of arc-disjoint arborescences such that each vertex v is contained in at least d(v) arborescences. We show that this problem is NP-hard in general."
101,2009.0,Christophe Meyer,"HEC Montreal, Canada",660,DISCRETE APPLIED MATHEMATICS,1182555," We present and compare three new compact linearizations for the quadratic 0-1 minimization problem, two of which achieve the same lower bound as does the ''standard linearization''. Two of the linearizations require the same number of constraints with respect to Glover's one, while the last one requires n additional constraints where n is the number of variables in the quadratic 0-1 problem. All three linearizations require the same number of additional variables as does Glover's linearization. This is an improvement on the linearization of Adams, Forrester and Glover (2004) which requires n additional variables and 2n additional constraints to reach the same lower bound as does the standard linearization. Computational results show however that linearizations achieving a weaker lower bound at the root node have better global performances than stronger linearizations when solved by Cplex."

135,2013.0,X. J. Zheng,"Tongji University, China",1277,JOURNAL OF GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION,2005303, In this paper we investigate a class of cardinality-constrained portfolio selection problems. We construct convex relaxations for this class of optimization problems via a new Lagrangian decomposition scheme. We show that the dual problem can be reduced to a second-order cone program problem which is tighter than the continuous relaxation of the standard mixed integer quadratically constrained quadratic program (MIQCQP) reformulation. We then propose a new MIQCQP reformulation which is more efficient than the standard MIQCQP reformulation in terms of the tightness of the continuous relaxations. Computational results are reported to demonstrate the tightness of the SOCP relaxation and the effectiveness of the new MIQCQP reformulation.

We introduce a notion of polynomial fixed-parameter tractability and prove that, under a very general constraint, an NP optimization problem has a fully polynomial time approximation scheme if and only if the problem is polynomial fixed-parameter tractable. By enforcing a constraint of planarity on the W-hierarchy studied in parameterized complexity theory, we obtain a class of NP optimization problems, the planar W-hierarchy, and prove that all problems in this class have efficient polynomial time approximation schemes (EPTAS). The planar W-hierarchy seems to contain most of the known EPTAS problems, and is significantly different from the class introduced by Khanna and Motwani in their efforts in characterizing optimization problems with polynomial time approximation schemes."

This notion was inspired by a striking result of Thue asserting that the path Pn on n vertices has a nonrepetitive three-colouring, no matter how large n is. A k-list assignment of a graph G is a mapping L which assigns a set L(v) of k permissible colours to each vertex v of G. The Thue choice number of G, denoted by πch(G), is the least integer k such that for every k-list assignment L there is a nonrepetitive colouring c of G satisfying c(v) ∈ L(v) for every vertex v of G.

204,2009.0,Zhensheng Yu,"University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, China",904,APPLIED NUMERICAL MATHEMATICS,1224818, A spectral gradient projection algorithm for monotone nonlinear equations with convex constraints is proposed. This new procedure is obtained by combining a modified spectral gradient method and a projection method. A relevant property of the presented method is that the computation of the iteration sequence does not require the solution of any subproblem. The algorithm is shown to be globally convergent under mild assumptions and it can be also applied to nonsmooth equations. Preliminary numerical tests show that the proposed method works quite well even for large scale problems.

The algorithm can be viewed as a “self-avoiding tree-indexed random walk“. The order of the tree T can be as large as a constant fraction of the order of the graph G, and the maximum degree of T can be close to the minimum degree of G. We show that our algorithm works in a variety of interesting settings. For example, we prove that any graph of minimum degree d without 4-cycles contains every tree of order εd 2 and maximum degree at most d-2εd-2. As there exist d-regular graphs without 4-cycles and with O(d 2) vertices, this result is optimal up to constant factors. We prove similar nearly tight results for graphs of given girth and graphs with no complete bipartite subgraph K s,t ."

In this paper we develop a convergent Lagrangian and domain cut method for solving this kind of problems. The proposed method exploits the special structure of the problem by Lagrangian decomposition and dual search. The domain cut is used to eliminate the duality gap and thus to guarantee the finding of an optimal exact solution to the primal problem. The algorithm is first motivated and developed for singly constrained nonlinear knapsack problems and is then extended to multiply constrained nonlinear knapsack problems. Computational results are presented for a variety of medium- or large-size nonlinear knapsack problems. Comparison results with other existing methods are also reported."

The bulk material is an isotropic elastic solid cut by pre-existing fault interfaces that accommodate relative motion of the material on the two sides. The fields across the interfaces are related through friction laws which depend on the sliding velocity, tractions acting on the interface, and state variables which evolve according to ordinary differential equations involving local fields.The method is based on summation-by-parts finite difference operators with irregular geometries handled through coordinate transforms and multi-block meshes. Boundary conditions as well as block interface conditions (whether frictional or otherwise) are enforced weakly through the simultaneous approximation term method, resulting in a provably stable discretization.The theoretical accuracy and stability results are confirmed with the method of manufactured solutions. The practical benefits of the new methodology are illustrated in a simulation of a subduction zone megathrust earthquake, a challenging application problem involving complex free-surface topography, nonplanar faults, and varying material properties."

313,2011.0,Ja-Yong Koo,"Korea University, Korea",246,COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS,1470091," Traditional classifiers including support vector machines use only labeled data in training. However, labeled instances are often difficult, costly, or time consuming to obtain while unlabeled instances are relatively easy to collect. The goal of semi-supervised learning is to improve the classification accuracy by using unlabeled data together with a few labeled data in training classifiers. Recently, the Laplacian support vector machine has been proposed as an extension of the support vector machine to semi-supervised learning. The Laplacian support vector machine has drawbacks in its interpretability as the support vector machine has. Also it performs poorly when there are many non-informative features in the training data because the final classifier is expressed as a linear combination of informative as well as non-informative features. We introduce a variant of the Laplacian support vector machine that is capable of feature selection based on functional analysis of variance decomposition. Through synthetic and benchmark data analysis, we illustrate that our method can be a useful tool in semi-supervised learning."
315,2014.0,Volker John,"Free University Berlin, Germany",1072,ADVANCES IN COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS,2089637," Standard error analysis for grad-div stabilization of inf-sup stable conforming pairs of finite element spaces predicts that the stabilization parameter should be optimally chosen to be &#119978;(1)$\mathcal O(1)$. This paper revisits this choice for the Stokes equations on the basis of minimizing the H1(Ω)$H^{1}(\Omega )$ error of the velocity and the L2(Ω)$L^{2}(\Omega )$ error of the pressure. It turns out, by applying a refined error analysis, that the optimal parameter choice is more subtle than known so far in the literature. It depends on the used norm, the solution, the family of finite element spaces, and the type of mesh. In particular, the approximation property of the pointwise divergence-free subspace plays a key role. With such an optimal approximation property and with an appropriate choice of the stabilization parameter, estimates for the H1(Ω)$H^{1}(\Omega )$ error of the velocity are obtained that do not directly depend on the viscosity and the pressure. The minimization of the L2(Ω)$L^{2}(\Omega )$ error of the pressure requires in many cases smaller stabilization parameters than the minimization of the H1(Ω)$H^{1}(\Omega )$ velocity error. Altogether, depending on the situation, the optimal stabilization parameter could range from being very small to very large. The analytic results are supported by numerical examples. Applying the analysis to the MINI element leads to proposals for the stabilization parameter which seem to be new."

Carstensen,"Yonsei University, Korea",2186,NUMERISCHE MATHEMATIK,1702231," This paper presents adaptive algorithms for eigenvalue problems associated with non-selfadjoint partial differential operators. The basis for the developed algorithms is a homotopy method which departs from a well-understood selfadjoint problem. Apart from the adaptive grid refinement, the progress of the homotopy as well as the solution of the iterative method are adapted to balance the contributions of the different error sources. The first algorithm balances the homotopy, discretization and approximation errors with respect to a fixed stepsize τ in the homotopy. The second algorithm combines the adaptive stepsize control for the homotopy with an adaptation in space that ensures an error below a fixed tolerance ε. The outcome of the analysis leads to the third algorithm which allows the complete adaptivity in space, homotopy stepsize as well as the iterative algebraic eigenvalue solver. All three algorithms are compared in numerical examples."

We apply this method to obtain new and simple proofs of two well known results: the Szemerédi–Trotter theorem on incidences of points and lines, and the existence of spanning trees with low crossing numbers.

For the problem, a few procedures have been proposed in the literature. However, most of the existing test procedures determine the test results or p-values based on ad hoc methods or the permutation approach. Furthermore for the test procedures whose asymptotic distributions have been derived, the results are only for the null hypothesis. In other words, no nonparametric test procedure exists that has a known asymptotic distribution under the alternative hypothesis and thus can be employed to carry out the power and test size calculation. In this paper, a new class of generalized log-rank tests is proposed and their asymptotic distributions are derived under both null and alternative hypotheses. A simulation study is conducted to assess their performance for finite sample situations and an illustrative example is provided."

In contrast to the existing methods in which the response distortion deteriorates estimation efficacy even for a simple linear model, the dimension reduction technique presented in this paper interestingly does not have to account for distortion of the response variable. The observed response can be used directly whether distortion is present or not. The resulting dimension reduction estimators are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal. The results can be employed to test whether the central dimension reduction subspace has been estimated appropriately and whether the components in the basis directions in the space are significant. Thus, the method provides an alternative for determining the structural dimension of the subspace and for variable selection.

For such systems implicit-explicit (IMEX) integration combines an explicit scheme for the non-stiff part with an implicit scheme for the stiff part. In a recent series of papers two of the authors (Sandu and Zhang) have developed IMEX GLMs, a family of implicit-explicit schemes based on general linear methods. It has been shown that, due to their high stage order, IMEX GLMs require no additional coupling order conditions, and are not marred by order reduction. This work develops a new extrapolation-based approach to construct practical IMEX GLM pairs of high order. We look for methods with large absolute stability region, assuming that the implicit part of the method is A- or L-stable. We provide examples of IMEX GLMs with optimal stability properties.

This discontinuity propagated along the integration interval giving rise to subsequent points, called ""singular points"", which can not be determined priori and the solution derivatives in these points are smoothed out along the interval. Most of the known numerical methods for this type of equations are generally very sensitive to the singular points and therefore must have a process that detects these points and insert them into the mesh to guarantee the required accuracy. Here, we present a numerical algorithm based on the piecewise collocation method and an approach for tracking the singular points relying on the recent strategy for implicit delay differential equations which has been proposed by Guglielmi and Hairer in 2008.

In order to find the unresolved part of the solution, the momentum equation is used to define the unresolved governing equation on the local level. Finally the application of the proposed method to incompressible fluid flow is displayed. Numerical solutions obtained from the two-level element-free Galerkin method are present for three benchmark problems, and the results indicate that the proposed method is a robust and accurate method.

One may think that the edges of G are colored with colors 0 and 1. In a friendship two-graph, every unordered pair of distinct vertices u, v is connected by a unique bicolored 2-path. The pairs of adjacency matrices of friendship two-graphs are solutions to the matrix equation AB + BA = J − I, where A and B are n × n symmetric 0 − 1 matrices, J is an n × n matrix with every entry being 1, and I is the identity n × n matrix. We show that there is no finite friendship two-graph with minimum vertex degree at most two.

The problem is exacerbated when the input data is noisy since accurate high frequency information is critical for detecting edges. The noise furthermore increases oscillations in the Fourier reconstruction of piecewise smooth functions, especially near the discontinuities. The edge detection method in Gelb and Tadmor (Appl Comput Harmon Anal 7:101---135, 1999, SIAM J Numer Anal 38(4):1389---1408, 2000) introduced the idea of ""concentration kernels"" as a way of converging to the singular support of a piecewise smooth function. The kernels used there, however, and subsequent modifications to reduce the impact of noise, were generally oscillatory, and as a result oscillations were always prevalent in the neighborhoods of the jump discontinuities. This paper revisits concentration kernels, but insists on uniform convergence to the ""sharp peaks"" of the function, that is, the edge detection method converges to zero away from the jumps without introducing new oscillations near them. We show that this is achievable via an admissible class of spectral mollifiers. Our method furthermore suppresses the oscillations caused by added noise."

662,2012.0,Jérôme Saracco,"University of Bordeaux, France",714,COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS,1716101," Sliced inverse regression (SIR) and related methods were introduced in order to reduce the dimensionality of regression problems. In general semiparametric regression framework, these methods determine linear combinations of a set of explanatory variables X related to the response variable Y, without losing information on the conditional distribution of Y given X. They are based on a “slicing step” in the population and sample versions. They are sensitive to the choice of the number H of slices, and this is particularly true for SIR-II and SAVE methods. At the moment there are no theoretical results nor practical techniques which allows the user to choose an appropriate number of slices. In this paper, we propose an approach based on the quality of the estimation of the effective dimension reduction (EDR) space: the square trace correlation between the true EDR space and its estimate can be used as goodness of estimation. We introduce a naïve bootstrap estimation of the square trace correlation criterion to allow selection of an “optimal” number of slices. Moreover, this criterion can also simultaneously select the corresponding suitable dimension K (number of the linear combination of X). From a practical point of view, the choice of these two parameters H and K is essential. We propose a 3D-graphical tool, implemented in R, which can be useful to select the suitable couple (H, K). An R package named “edrGraphicalTools” has been developed. In this article, we focus on the SIR-I, SIR-II and SAVE methods. Moreover the proposed criterion can be use to determine which method seems to be efficient to recover the EDR space, that is the structure between Y and X. We indicate how the proposed criterion can be used in practice. A simulation study is performed to illustrate the behavior of this approach and the need for selecting properly the number H of slices and the dimension K. A short real-data example is also provided."

680,2013.0,Wei Wu,"Florida State University, USA",1741,COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS,1949768," Constructing generative models for functional observations is an important task in statistical functional analysis. In general, functional data contains both phase (or x or horizontal) and amplitude (or y or vertical) variability. Traditional methods often ignore the phase variability and focus solely on the amplitude variation, using cross-sectional techniques such as fPCA for dimensional reduction and data modeling. Ignoring phase variability leads to a loss of structure in the data and inefficiency in data models. This paper presents an approach that relies on separating the phase (x-axis) and amplitude (y-axis), then modeling these components using joint distributions. This separation, in turn, is performed using a technique called elastic shape analysis of curves that involves a new mathematical representation of functional data. Then, using individual fPCAs, one each for phase and amplitude components, it imposes joint probability models on principal coefficients of these components while respecting the nonlinear geometry of the phase representation space. These ideas are demonstrated using random sampling, for models estimated from simulated and real datasets, and show their superiority over models that ignore phase-amplitude separation. Furthermore, the generative models are applied to classification of functional data and achieve high performance in applications involving SONAR signals of underwater objects, handwritten signatures, and periodic body movements recorded by smart phones."

Our goal is to classify the equivalence classes among two-element pattern sets of several general types. First, we focus on pairs of patterns {@s,@t}, where @s is a pattern of size three with at least two distinct symbols and @t is an arbitrary pattern of size k that avoids @s. We show that pattern-pairs of this type determine a small number of equivalence classes; in particular, the classes have on average exponential size in k. We provide a (sub-exponential) upper bound for the number of equivalence classes, and provide an explicit formula for the generating function of all such avoidance classes, showing that in all cases this generating function is rational. Next, we study partitions avoiding a pair of patterns of the form (1212,@t), where @t is an arbitrary pattern. Note that partitions avoiding 1212 are exactly the non-crossing partitions. We provide several general equivalence criteria for pattern-pairs of this type, and show that these criteria account for all the equivalences observed when @t has size at most six.

Furthermore, we present an algorithm for increasing the number of vanishing moments of wavelet bi-frames to arbitrary order by the presented lifting scheme, which adopts an iterative algorithm.

Rinaldi,"University of Siena, Italy",1781,DISCRETE APPLIED MATHEMATICS,2004638," In this paper we explore the connections between two classes of polyominoes, namely the permutominoes and the pseudo-square polyominoes. A permutomino is a polyomino uniquely determined by a pair of permutations. Permutominoes, and in particular convex permutominoes, have been considered in various kinds of problems such as: enumeration, tomographical reconstruction, and algebraic characterization. On the other hand, pseudo-square polyominoes are a class of polyominoes tiling the plane by translation. The characterization of such objects has been given by Beauquier and Nivat, who proved that a polyomino tiles the plane by translation if and only if it is a pseudo-square or a pseudo-hexagon. In particular, a polyomino is pseudo-square if its boundary word may be factorized as XYX@^Y@^, where X@^ denotes the path X traveled in the opposite direction. In this paper we relate the two concepts by considering the pseudo-square polyominoes which are also convex permutominoes. By using the Beauquier-Nivat characterization we provide some geometrical and combinatorial properties of such objects, and we show for any fixed X, each word Y such that XYX@^Y@^ is pseudo-square is prefix of a unique infinite word Y""~ with period 4|X|""N|X|""E.

888,2013.0,Jia Li,"National University of Singapore, Singapore",1684,JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING,1948905," X-ray computed tomography (CT) has been playing an important role in diagnostic of cancer and radiotherapy. However, high imaging dose added to healthy organs during CT scans is a serious clinical concern. Imaging dose in CT scans can be reduced by reducing the number of X-ray projections. In this paper, we consider 2D CT reconstructions using very small number of projections. Some regularization based reconstruction methods have already been proposed in the literature for such task, like the total variation (TV) based reconstruction (Sidky and Pan in Phys. Med. Biol. 53:4777, 2008; Sidky et al. in J. X-Ray Sci. Technol. 14(2):119---139, 2006; Jia et al. in Med. Phys. 37:1757, 2010; Choi et al. in Med. Phys. 37:5113, 2010) and balanced approach with wavelet frame based regularization (Jia et al. in Phys. Med. Biol. 56:3787---3807, 2011). For most of the existing methods, at least 40 projections is usually needed to get a satisfactory reconstruction. In order to keep radiation dose as minimal as possible, while increase the quality of the reconstructed images, one needs to enhance the resolution of the projected image in the Radon domain without increasing the total number of projections. The goal of this paper is to propose a CT reconstruction model with wavelet frame based regularization and Radon domain inpainting. The proposed model simultaneously reconstructs a high quality image and its corresponding high resolution measurements in Radon domain. In addition, we discovered that using the isotropic wavelet frame regularization proposed in Cai et al. (Image restorations: total variation, wavelet frames and beyond, 2011, preprint) is superior than using its anisotropic counterpart. Our proposed model, as well as other models presented in this paper, is solved rather efficiently by split Bregman algorithm (Goldstein and Osher in SIAM J.

The ERKN integrators are important generalizations of the classical Runge-Kutta-Nystrom methods in the sense that both the updates and internal stages have been reformed so that the quantitative behavior of ERKN integrators is adapted to the oscillatory properties of the true solution. By the expansions for the errors of explicit ERKN integrators, we derive stiff order conditions up to order three and present the error bounds. We show that the explicit ERKN integrator fulfilling stiff order p converges with order p, and for an important particular case where M is a symmetric and positive semi-definite matrix, the error bound of@?q""n-q(t""n)@?is independent of@?M@?

Numerical experiments carried out show that our new explicit multi-frequency and multidimensional ERKN integrator is more efficient than various other existing effective methods in the scientific literature.

Although the CVaR function is nondifferentiable, scenario-based CVaR minimization problems can be reformulated as linear programs (LPs) that afford solutions via widely-used commercial softwares. However, finding solutions through LP formulations for problems having many financial instruments and a large number of price scenarios can be time-consuming as the dimension of the problem greatly increases. In this paper, we propose a two-phase approach that is suitable for solving CVaR minimization problems having a large number of price scenarios. In the first phase, conventional differentiable optimization techniques are used while circumventing nondifferentiable points, and in the second phase, we employ a theoretically convergent, variable target value nondifferentiable optimization technique. The resultant two-phase procedure guarantees infinite convergence to optimality. As an optional third phase, we additionally perform a switchover to a simplex solver starting with a crash basis obtained from the second phase when finite convergence to an exact optimum is desired. This three phase procedure substantially reduces the effort required in comparison with the direct use of a commercial stand-alone simplex solver (CPLEX 9.0). Moreover, the two-phase method provides highly-accurate near-optimal solutions with a significantly improved performance over the interior point barrier implementation of CPLEX 9.0 as well, especially when the number of scenarios is large.

Correspondence problems have been studied for almost 30 years, and energy-based methods such as variational approaches have become popular for solving this task. However, despite the long history of research in this field, only little attention has been paid to the numerical approximation of derivatives that naturally occur in variational approaches.In this paper we show that strategies from hyperbolic numerics can lead to a significant quality gain in computational results. Starting from a basic formulation of correspondence problems, we take on a novel perspective on the mathematical model. Switching the roles of known and unknown with respect to image data and displacement field, we use the arising hyperbolic colour equation as a basis for a refined numerical approach. For its discretisation, we propose to use one-sided differences in the correct direction identified via a smooth predictor solution. The one-sided differences that are first-order accurate are blended with higher-order central schemes. Thereby the blending mechanism interpolates between the following two situations: The one-sided method is employed at image edges which often coincide with edges in the displacement field. In smooth image parts the higher-order scheme is used. We apply our new scheme to several prototypes of variational models for optic flow and stereo reconstruction, where we achieve significant qualitative improvements compared to standard discretisations."

Next, we do the odd extension for v, and then do the periodic extension, i.e. we obtain a periodic odd function v *. Finally, we expand v * into Fourier sine series. In this paper, we propose to expand v * into a periodic wavelet series with respect to biorthonormal periodic wavelet bases with the symmetric filter banks. We call this the Harmonic Wavelet Transform (HWT). HWT has an advantage over both the LLST and the conventional wavelet transforms. On the one hand, it removes the boundary mismatches as LLST does. On the other hand, the HWT coefficients reflect the local smoothness of f in the interior of 驴. So the HWT algorithm approximates data more efficiently than LLST, periodic wavelet transform, folded wavelet transform, and wavelets on interval.

One of the most important techniques for analyzing hyperspectral images is spectral unmixing, in which mixed pixels (resulting from insufficient spatial resolution of the imaging sensor) are decomposed into a collection of spectrally pure constituent spectra, called endmembers weighted by their correspondent fractions, or abundances. Over the last years, several algorithms have been developed for automatic endmember extraction. Many of them assume that the images contain at least one pure spectral signature for each distinct material. However, this assumption is usually not valid due to spatial resolution, mixing phenomena, and other considerations. A recent trend in the hyperspectral imaging community is to design endmember identification algorithms which do not assume the presence of pure pixels. Despite the proliferation of this kind of algorithms, many of which are based on minimum enclosing simplex concepts, a rigorous quantitative and comparative assessment is not yet available. In this paper, we provide a comparative analysis of endmember extraction algorithms without the pure pixel assumption.

However, the subproblem in the trust region method is difficult or time-consuming to solve in practical computation, especially in large-scale problems. In this paper we consider a new class of trust region methods, specifically subspace trust region methods. The subproblem in these methods has an adequate initial trust region radius and can be solved in a simple subspace. It is easier to solve than the original subproblem because the dimension of the subproblem in the subspace is reduced substantially.

This decomposition result parallels an analogous, simpler result for edge deletions instead of contractions, obtained in [4,20, 10, 17], and it generalizes a similar result for “compression” (a variant of contraction) in planar graphs [29]. Our decomposition result is a powerful tool for obtaining PTASs for contraction-closed problems (whose optimal solution only improves under contraction), a much more general class than minor-closed problems. We prove that any contraction-closed problem satisfying just a few simple conditions has a PTAS in bounded-genus graphs. In particular, our framework yields PTASs for the weighted Traveling Salesman Problem and for minimum-weight c-edge-connected submultigraph on bounded-genus graphs, improving and generalizing previous algorithms of [24, 1, 29, 25, 8, 5].

The proposed extension deals with the multi-class transductive learning problem, which consists in learning several classes with a set of labels for each class. Learning several classes (i.e. more than two classes) simultaneously is generally a challenging problem, but the proposed method builds on strong results introduced in imaging to overcome the multi-class issue. Besides, the proposed multi-class transductive learning algorithms also benefit from recent fast ℓ1 solvers, specifically designed for the total variation norm, which plays a central role in our approach. Finally, experiments demonstrate that the proposed ℓ1 relaxation algorithms are more accurate and robust than standard ℓ2 relaxation methods s.a. spectral clustering, particularly when considering a very small number of labels for each class to be classified. For instance, the mean error of classification for the benchmark MNIST dataset of 60,000 data in $\mathbb{R}^{784}$ using the proposed ℓ1 relaxation of the multi-class Cheeger cut is 2.4聽% when only one label is considered for each class, while the error of classification for the ℓ2 relaxation method of spectral clustering is 24.7聽%."

The study of CACs has been focused on determining the size of an optimal code, i.e., the maximum size of a code, and in the past few years it has been settled by several researchers for even length and weight 3 together with constructions. As for odd length, a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a 'tight equi-difference' CAC of weight 3 can be found in Momihara (2007), but the condition is fairly complex and thus only a few explicit series of code lengths are known. Recently, Fu et al. (2013) restated the condition given by Momihara (2007) in a different way, which requires to examine the multiplicative suborder of 2 modulo p for each prime factor p of m. Meanwhile, Ma et al. (2013) presented constructions of an optimal equi-difference CAC and an optimal tight CAC of odd prime length p and weight 3, and formulated the sizes of such optimal codes. However, for their formulae to have practical meaning, the number of cosets of -(2)""p@?(2)""p still needs to be determined, where (2)""p is the multiplicative subgroup of Z""p^@? with generator 2. Moreover, their construction of an optimal tight CAC imposes a certain condition. This implies that even restricting ourselves to odd prime length, to provide a series of odd code length for which the maximum size of a CAC of weight 3 can be determined is a demanding problem. In this article, we will give some explicit series of tight/optimal equi-difference CACs of odd length and weight 3 by revisiting some properties of multiplicative order of a unit in the ring of residues modulo m and cyclotomic polynomials."

We suggest a tracking-based method for estimating a support boundary when it is composed of a finite number of smooth curves, meeting together at corners. The smooth parts of the boundary are assumed to have continuously turning tangents and bounded curvature, and the corners are not allowed to be infinitely sharp; that is, the angle between the two tangents should not equal π. In other respects, however, the boundary may be quite general. In particular it need not be uniquely defined in Cartesian coordinates, its corners my be either concave or convex, and its smooth parts may be neither concave nor convex. Tracking methods are well suited to such generalities, and they also have the advantage of requiring relatively small amounts of computation. It is shown that they achieve optimal convergence rates, in the sense of uniform approximation."

OT can be used to protect user's privacy. In principle, any user can interact with a server to request some services. This might allow some undesirable users to obtain services from the server. How to ensure that only the authorized receivers can obtain services obliviously is a daunting task. In this paper, we introduce oblivious signature based-on envelope (OSBE) to OT and propose two novel OT schemes, which only allow the legitimate receivers to obtain services obliviously. The receiver is required to authenticate himself to the issuer to possess the required credential prior to access the protected services; while no authentication from the sender needs to be done. The sender knows the number of the services selected by the receiver, but does not know anything about his choices and personally identifiable information.

We propose the combined quasi and empirical likelihood (CQEL) to incorporate such auxiliary information to improve the efficiency of parameter estimation of the quasi-likelihood in GLMs with missing responses. We show that, when assuming responses are missing at random (MAR), the CQEL estimator achieves better efficiency than the maximum quasi-likelihood (MQL) estimator due to utilization of the auxiliary information. When there is no auxiliary information, we show that the CQEL estimator of the mean response is more efficient than the existing imputation estimators. Based on the asymptotic property of the CQEL estimator, we also develop Wilks' type tests and corresponding confidence regions for the regression parameter and mean response. The merits of the CQEL are further illustrated through simulation studies."

The special case k=2 has been studied under the names induced matching (i.e., a matching which forms an induced subgraph in G) by Cameron and strong matching by Golumbic and Laskar in various papers. Finding a maximum induced matching is NP-complete even on very restricted bipartite graphs and on claw-free graphs but it can be done efficiently on various classes of graphs such as chordal graphs, based on the fact that an induced matching in G corresponds to an independent vertex set in the square L(G)^2 of the line graph L(G) of G which, by a result of Cameron, is chordal for any chordal graph G. We show that, unlike for k=2, for a chordal graph G, L(G)^3 is not necessarily chordal, and finding a maximum distance-3 matching, and more generally, finding a maximum distance-(2k+1) matching for k=1, remains NP-complete on chordal graphs. For strongly chordal graphs and interval graphs, however, the maximum distance-k matching problem can be solved in polynomial time for every k=1. Moreover, we obtain various new results for maximum induced matchings on subclasses of claw-free graphs."

A novel approach to estimating the parameters in this mixture model is presented by maximizing the penalized marginal likelihood via iterative quadratic programming. The motivation for the penalized marginal likelihood stems from an underlying Bayesian model that imposes a prior distribution on the parameter of each Archimedean copula family. An approximative marginal likelihood is obtained by a classical quadrature discretization of the integral w.r.t. each family-specific prior distribution, thus yielding a finite mixture model. Family-specific smoothness penalties are added and the penalized marginal likelihood is maximized using an iterative quadratic programming routine. For comparison purposes, we also present a fully Bayesian approach via simulation-based posterior computation. The performance of the novel estimation approach is evaluated by simulations and two examples involving the modelling of the interdependence of exchange rates and of wind speed measurements, respectively. For these examples, penalized marginal likelihood estimates are compared to the corresponding Bayesian estimates."

The optimal large deviation decay rate can be arbitrarily close to the one for the corresponding probability in an infinite-server queue, which only depends on the system traffic intensity but not on any higher moments of the job size distribution. This supports in a many-server asymptotic framework the common wisdom that separating large jobs from small jobs protects system performance against job size variability."

The radius of these stencils is not a-priori bounded however, and can be quite large for pronounced anisotropies. Our scheme also has good spectral properties, which permits larger time steps and avoids e.g. chessboard artifacts.AD-LBR relies on Lattice Basis Reduction, a tool from discrete mathematics which has recently shown its relevance for the discretization on grids of strongly anisotropic Partial Differential Equations (Mirebeau in Preprint, 2012). We prove that AD-LBR is in 2D asymptotically equivalent to a finite element discretization on an anisotropic Delaunay triangulation, a procedure more involved and computationally expensive. Our scheme thus benefits from the theoretical guarantees of this procedure, for a fraction of its cost. Numerical experiments in 2D and 3D illustrate our results."

These classes are defined by the fact that the maximum average degree of a shallow minor of a graph in the class is bounded by a function of the depth of the shallow minor. Several linear-time algorithms are known for bounded expansion classes (such as subgraph isomorphism testing), and they allow restricted homomorphism dualities, amongst other desirable properties. In this paper, we establish two new characterisations of bounded expansion classes, one in terms of so-called topological parameters and the other in terms of controlling dense parts. The latter characterisation is then used to show that the notion of bounded expansion is compatible with the Erdos-Renyi model of random graphs with constant average degree. In particular, we prove that for every fixed d0, there exists a class with bounded expansion, such that a random graph of order n and edge probability d/n asymptotically almost surely belongs to the class. We then present several new examples of classes with bounded expansion that do not exclude some topological minor, and appear naturally in the context of graph drawing or graph colouring. In particular, we prove that the following classes have bounded expansion: graphs that can be drawn in the plane with a bounded number of crossings per edge, graphs with bounded stack number, graphs with bounded queue number, and graphs with bounded non-repetitive chromatic number. We also prove that graphs with 'linear' crossing number are contained in a topologically-closed class, while graphs with bounded crossing number are contained in a minor-closed class."

The paper is concerned with the analysis and design of IG-FRBFNNs and their optimization by means of the Hierarchical Fair Competition-based Parallel Genetic Algorithm (HFC-PGA).

Moreover, the weighted Least Square (WLS) learning is exploited to estimate the coefficients of the polynomial forming the conclusion part of the rules. Since the performance of the IG-RBFNN model is affected by some key design parameters, such as a specific subset of input variables, the fuzzification coefficient of the FCM, the number of rules, and the order of polynomial of the consequent part of fuzzy rules, it becomes beneficial to carry out both structural as well as parametric optimization of the network.

For practical applications, we use a multiplicative combination of filtering based preconditioners with the classical ILU(0) preconditioner, which is known to be efficient. Although the left filtering condition has a more sound theoretical motivation than the right one, extensive tests on convection-diffusion equations with heterogeneous and anisotropic diffusion tensors reveal that satisfying left or right filtering conditions lead to comparable results. On the filtering vector, these numerical tests reveal that e=[1,...,1]^T is a reasonable choice, which is effective and can avoid the preprocessing needed in other methods to build the filtering vector. Numerical tests show that the composite preconditioners are rather robust and efficient for these problems with strongly varying coefficients."

The proposed extension deals with the multi-class transductive learning problem, which consists in learning several classes with a set of labels for each class. Learning several classes (i.e. more than two classes) simultaneously is generally a challenging problem, but the proposed method builds on strong results introduced in imaging to overcome the multi-class issue. Besides, the proposed multi-class transductive learning algorithms also benefit from recent fast ℓ1 solvers, specifically designed for the total variation norm, which plays a central role in our approach. Finally, experiments demonstrate that the proposed ℓ1 relaxation algorithms are more accurate and robust than standard ℓ2 relaxation methods s.a. spectral clustering, particularly when considering a very small number of labels for each class to be classified. For instance, the mean error of classification for the benchmark MNIST dataset of 60,000 data in $\mathbb{R}^{784}$ using the proposed ℓ1 relaxation of the multi-class Cheeger cut is 2.4聽% when only one label is considered for each class, while the error of classification for the ℓ2 relaxation method of spectral clustering is 24.7聽%."

Existing approaches to variable selection in a binary classification context are sensitive to outliers, heteroskedasticity or other anomalies of the latent response. The method proposed in this study overcomes these problems in an attractive and straightforward way. A Laplace likelihood and Laplace priors for the regression parameters are proposed and estimated with Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo. The resulting model is equivalent to the frequentist lasso procedure. A conceptional result is that by doing so, the binary regression model is moved from a Gaussian to a full Laplacian framework without sacrificing much computational efficiency. In addition, an efficient Gibbs sampler to estimate the model parameters is proposed that is superior to the Metropolis algorithm that is used in previous studies on Bayesian binary quantile regression. Both the simulation studies and the real data analysis indicate that the proposed method performs well in comparison to the other methods. Moreover, as the base model is binary quantile regression, a much more detailed insight in the effects of the covariates is provided by the approach.

The proposed method generalizes an over-dispersion test previously suggested for un-truncated count data and may also be used for testing residual over-dispersion in zero-inflation data. Simulations suggest that the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic is standard normal and that this approximation is also reasonable for small sample sizes. The method is also shown to be more efficient than an existing test for over-dispersion adapted for the capture-recapture setting.

This method maintains conservation property associated with the Navier---Stokes equations. An error analysis based on the variational formulation of the corresponding finite volume method is first introduced to obtain optimal error estimates for velocity and pressure. This error analysis shows that the present stabilized finite volume method provides an approximate solution with the same convergence rate as that provided by the stabilized linear finite element method for the Navier---Stokes equations under the same regularity assumption on the exact solution and a slightly additional regularity on the source term. The stability and convergence results of the proposed method are also demonstrated by the numerical experiments presented.

The success of wavelet frames in image restoration is mainly due to their capability of sparsely approximating piecewise smooth functions like images. Most of the wavelet frame based models designed in the past are based on the penalization of the 驴 1 norm of wavelet frame coefficients, which, under certain conditions, is the right choice, as supported by theories of compressed sensing (Candes et al. in Appl. Comput. Harmon. Anal., 2010; Candes et al. in IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 52(2):489---509, 2006; Donoho in IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 52:1289---1306, 2006). However, the assumptions of compressed sensing may not be satisfied in practice (e.g. for image deblurring and CT image reconstruction). Recently in Zhang et al. (UCLA CAM Report, vol. 11-32, 2011), the authors propose to penalize the l 0 ""norm"" of the wavelet frame coefficients instead, and they have demonstrated significant improvements of their method over some commonly used l 1 minimization models in terms of quality of the recovered images. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, called the mean doubly augmented Lagrangian (MDAL) method, for l 0 minimizations based on the classical doubly augmented Lagrangian (DAL) method (Rockafellar in Math.

This bandwidth allocation problem is a special chromatic scheduling problem; both problems are NP-complete and, furthermore, there exist no polynomial-time algorithms with a fixed quality guarantee for them. As algorithms based on cutting planes are shown to be successful for many other combinatorial optimization problems, the goal is to apply such methods to the bandwidth allocation problem. For that, knowledge on the associated polytopes is required. The present paper contributes to this issue, introducing new classes of valid inequalities based on variations and extensions of the covering-clique inequalities presented in [J.

For a stationary Boolean model with convex grains we consider a recently developed collection of shape descriptors, the so called Minkowski tensors. By combining spatial and probabilistic averaging we define Minkowski tensor densities of a Boolean model. These densities are global characteristics of the union set which can be estimated from observations. In contrast local characteristics like the mean Minkowski tensor of a single random particle cannot be observed directly, since the particles overlap. We relate the global to the local properties by density formulas for the Minkowski tensors. These density formulas generalize the well known formulas for intrinsic volume densities and are obtained by applying results from translative integral geometry. Our results support the idea that the degree of anisotropy of a Boolean model may be expressed in terms of the Minkowski tensor densities. Furthermore we observe that for smooth grains the mean curvature radius function of a particle can be reconstructed from the Minkowski tensor densities. In a simulation study we numerically determine Minkowski tensor densities for non-isotropic Boolean models based on ellipses and on rectangles in two dimensions and find excellent agreement with the derived analytic density formulas. The tensor densities can be used to characterize the orientational distribution of the grains and to estimate model parameters for non-isotropic distributions. In particular, the numerically determined values for the density of the Euler characteristic allow the estimation of certain mixed functionals of the grains."

Singh,"University of Leipzig, Germany",1393,MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTERS IN SIMULATION,1881166," In this paper, conceptual modeling as well as numerical simulation of two-phase flow in deep, deformable geological formations induced by CO""2 injection are presented. The conceptual approach is based on balance equations for mass, momentum and energy completed by appropriate constitutive relations for the fluid phases as well as the solid matrix. Within the context of the primary effects under consideration, the fluid motion will be expressed by the extended Darcy's law for two phase flow. Additionally, constraint conditions for the partial saturations and the pressure fractions of carbon dioxide and brine are defined. To characterize the stress state in the solid matrix, the effective stress principle is applied. Furthermore, the interaction of fluid and solid phases is illustrated by constitutive models for capillary pressure, porosity and permeability as functions of saturation. Based on this conceptual model, a coupled system of nonlinear differential equations for two-phase flow in a deformable porous matrix (H^2M model) is formulated. As the displacement vector acts as primary variable for the solid matrix, multiphase flow is simulated using both pressure/pressure or pressure/saturation formulations. An object-oriented finite element method is used to solve the multi-field problem numerically. The capabilities of the model and the numerical tools to treat complex processes during CO""2 sequestration are demonstrated on three benchmark examples: (1) a 1-D case to investigate the influence of variable fluid properties, (2) 2-D vertical axi-symmetric cross-section to study the interaction between hydraulic and deformation processes, and (3) 3-D to test the stability and computational costs of the H^2M model for real applications."

They use complex contour integration to implement these schemes in a way that avoids inaccuracies when inverting matrix polynomials, but this approach creates new difficulties in choosing and evaluating the contour for larger problems. Neither treatment addresses problems with nonsmooth data, where spurious oscillations can swamp the numerical approximations if one does not treat the problem carefully. Such problems with irregular initial data or mismatched initial and boundary conditions are important in various applications, including computational chemistry and financial engineering. We introduce a new version of the fourth-order Cox-Matthews, Kassam-Trefethen ETDRK4 scheme designed to eliminate the remaining computational difficulties. This new scheme utilizes an exponential time differencing Runge-Kutta ETDRK scheme using a diagonal Pade approximation of matrix exponential functions, while to deal with the problem of nonsmooth data we use several steps of an ETDRK scheme using a sub-diagonal Pade formula. The new algorithm improves computational efficiency with respect to evaluation of the high degree polynomial functions of matrices, having an advantage of splitting the matrix polynomial inversion problem into a sum of linear problems that can be solved in parallel. In this approach it is only required that several backward Euler linear problems be solved, in serial or parallel. Numerical experiments are described to support the new scheme."

The critical vaccination rate @j^* above which the endemic infection dies out and the conditions on model parameters that ensure its existence are obtained. It has been found that eliminating the infection requires an application of control measures other than vaccination to reduce the basic reproduction number to below the reinfection threshold and then vaccinate susceptible individuals with a rate slightly greater than @j^*. The implication is that, generally, even if all newborns get vaccinated immediately after birth, an effective control is not necessarily assured except if the basic reproduction number is reduced to below the reinfection threshold.

The method suggested is in full generality as it may be applied to arbitrary laws with continuous or discrete distribution functions, provided that an efficient method of estimation exists for the parameters. We investigate by Monte Carlo the relative performance of classical tests based on the empirical distribution function, in comparison to a corresponding test which instead of the empirical distribution function, utilizes the empirical characteristic function.

The interproximate subdivision also contains tension parameters assigned to vertices or edges for shape adjustment. Compared to the 4-point interpolatory subdivision scheme, the interproximate subdivision does not force the new inserted vertices to be interpolated and is thus expected to have improved behavior; and compared to the cubic B-spline refinement scheme, the interproximate subdivision is able to generate curves interpolating user-specified vertices.

This result, which illustrates the power of counting, is considered to be a seminal result in computational complexity theory. An analogous result in the complexity theory over the reals (in the sense of Blum–Shub–Smale real machines in Bull. Am. Math. Soc. (NS) 21(1): 1–46, 1989) has been missing so far. In this paper we formulate and prove a real analogue of Toda’s theorem. Unlike Toda’s proof in the discrete case, which relied on sophisticated combinatorial arguments, our proof is topological in nature. As a consequence of our techniques, we are also able to relate the computational hardness of two extremely well-studied problems in algorithmic semi-algebraic geometry: the problem of deciding sentences in the first-order theory of the reals with a constant number of quantifier alternations, and that of computing Betti numbers of semi-algebraic sets.

The simulation results indicated that with the exhaustion of high-carbon nonrenewable energy and stagnant/slow development of low-carbon renewable energy, the number of industrial firm is lowest and that this energy structure cannot sustain the security of their energy supply. Meanwhile, with the development of both high-carbon and low-carbon energy, the number of industrial firms increases sharply compared with the abovementioned condition, but challenges sustainable development. In contrast, the simulation results also indicated that the development of renewable low-carbon energy ensures the energy supply security of industrial firms, and furthermore, that the best way to sustained a greater number of industrial firms is to decrease the energy consumption of the industrial firms themselves. This means that low-carbon awareness and the behavior of firms play a significant role in developing low-carbon energy.

Meanwhile, explicit formulas for the MLE of parameters of Xie-Tang-Goh's model (Xie et al., 2002) are given for both types of data in the paper. The results from using these two models are compared to some real data sets both in terms of AIC values and in terms of how well the intensity is fitted.

First, we propose an abstract model for problems of data recovery and derive error bounds for two different recovery schemes, namely ℓ1 minimization and thresholding. Second, we set up a particular microlocal model for an image governed by edges inspired by seismic data as well as a particular mask to model the missing data, namely a linear singularity masked by a horizontal strip.

For instance, given a graph and an integer k, the maximum edge subgraph problem consists of finding a k-vertex subset such that the number of edges within the subset is maximum. This work proposes a polyhedral approach for this NP-hard problem. We study the polytope associated to an integer programming formulation of the problem, present several families of facet-inducing valid inequalities, and discuss the separation problem associated to these families.

Liu,"Florida State University, USA",1741,APPLIED STOCHASTIC MODELS IN BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY,1842987," In our technological era, non-Euclidean data abound, especially because of advances in digital imaging. Patrangenaru (‘Asymptotic statistics on manifolds’, PhD Dissertation, 1998) introduced extrinsic and intrinsic means on manifolds, as location parameters for non-Euclidean data. A large sample nonparametric theory of inference on manifolds was developed by Bhattacharya and Patrangenaru (J. Stat. Plann. Inferr., 108, 23–35, 2002; Ann. Statist., 31, 1–29, 2003; Ann. Statist., 33, 1211–1245, 2005). A flurry of papers in computer vision, statistical learning, pattern recognition, medical imaging, and other computational intensive applied areas using these concepts followed. While pursuing such location parameters in various instances of data analysis on manifolds, scientists are using intrinsic means, almost without exception. In this paper, we point out that there is no unique intrinsic analysis because the latter depends on the choice of the Riemannian metric on the manifold, and in dimension two or higher, there are infinitely such nonisometric choices. Also, using John Nash's celebrated isometric embedding theorem and an equivariant version, we show that for each intrinsic analysis there is an extrinsic counterpart that is computationally faster and give some concrete examples in shape and image analysis. The computational speed is important, especially in automated industrial processes. In this paper, we mention two potential applications in the industry and give a detailed presentation of one such application, for quality control in a manufacturing process via 3D projective shape analysis from multiple digital camera images.

We give two general results on local testability: First, motivated by the recently proposed notion of robust probabilistically checkable proofs, we introduce the notion of robust local testability of codes. We relate this notion to a product of codes introduced by Tanner and show a very simple composition lemma for this notion. Next, we show that codes built by tensor products can be tested robustly and somewhat locally by applying a variant of a test and proof technique introduced by Raz and Safra in the context of testing low-degree multivariate polynomials (which are a special case of tensor codes). Combining these two results gives us a generic construction of codes of inverse polynomial rate that are testable with poly-logarithmically many queries. We note that these locally testable tensor codes can be obtained from any linear error correcting code with good distance. Previous results on local testability, albeit much stronger quantitatively, rely heavily on algebraic properties of the underlying codes. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct.

The vertex unknowns are treated as intermediate ones and are expressed as a linear combination of the neighboring cell-centered unknowns, which reduces the scheme to a cell-centered one with a local stencil involving nine cell-centered unknowns. The coefficients in the linear combination are known as the weights and two types of new weights are proposed. These new weights are neither discontinuity dependent nor mesh topology dependent, have explicit expressions, can reduce to the one-dimensional harmonic-average weights on the nonuniform rectangular meshes, and moreover, are easily extended to the unstructured polygonal meshes and non-matching meshes. Both the derivation of the nine-point scheme and that of new weights satisfy the linearity preserving criterion.

We prove that for a large class of patterns, this inverse is always an entire function. We also complete the classification of consecutive patterns of length up to 6 into equivalence classes, proving a conjecture of Nakamura.

NMF and NTF are low-rank approximation methods for matrices and tensors in which the low-rank factors are constrained to have only nonnegative elements. The nonnegativity constraints have been shown to enable natural interpretations and allow better solutions in numerous applications including text analysis, computer vision, and bioinformatics. However, the computation of NMF and NTF remains challenging and expensive due the constraints. Numerous algorithmic approaches have been proposed to efficiently compute NMF and NTF. The BCD framework in constrained non-linear optimization readily explains the theoretical convergence properties of several efficient NMF and NTF algorithms, which are consistent with experimental observations reported in literature. In addition, we discuss algorithms that do not fit in the BCD framework contrasting them from those based on the BCD framework. With insights acquired from the unified perspective, we also propose efficient algorithms for updating NMF when there is a small change in the reduced dimension or in the data. The effectiveness of the proposed updating algorithms are validated experimentally with synthetic and real-world data sets."

HFSP is fairly common in flexible manufacturing and in process industry. This paper presents an efficient quantum immune algorithm (QIA) for HFSP. The objective is to find an optimal job sequence that minimize the mean flow time. Since HFSP has been proved to be NP-hard in a strong sense even in case of two stages, immune algorithm (IA) and quantum algorithm (QA) are used to solve the problem, respectively. To improve the performance of IA, an effective IA with new adaptive crossover and fractional parts mutation operators is proposed, which is called AIA. A randomly replacing strategy is employed to promote population diversity of QA, namely RRQA. In order to achieve better results, the paper proposes a quantum immune algorithm (QIA), which combines IA with QA to optimize the HFSP. Furthermore, all the improvements are added into QIA to be ARRQIA, which possesses the merits of global exploration, fast convergence, and robustness. The simulation results show that the proposed AIA significantly enhances the performance of IA. RRQA also produces more efficient and more stable results than QA. So far as ARRQIA is concerned, it outperforms the other algorithms in the paper and the average solution quality has increased by 3.37% and 6.82% compared with IA and QA on the total 60 instances."

3324,2013.0,V. F. Demyanov,"Saint Petersburg State University, Russia",269,JOURNAL OF GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION,2007869," The notions of upper and lower exhausters represent generalizations of the notions of exhaustive families of upper convex and lower concave approximations (u.c.a., l.c.a.). The notions of u.c.a.'s and l.c.a.'s were introduced by Pshenichnyi (Convex Analysis and Extremal Problems, Series in Nonlinear Analysis and its Applications, 1980), while the notions of exhaustive families of u.c.a.'s and l.c.a.'s were described by Demyanov and Rubinov in Nonsmooth Problems of Optimization Theory and Control, Leningrad University Press, Leningrad, 1982. These notions allow one to solve the problem of optimization of an arbitrary function by means of Convex Analysis thus essentially extending the area of application of Convex Analysis. In terms of exhausters it is possible to describe extremality conditions, and it turns out that conditions for a minimum are expressed via an upper exhauster while conditions for a maximum are formulated in terms of a lower exhauster (Abbasov and Demyanov (2010), Demyanov and Roshchina (Appl Comput Math 4(2): 114---124, 2005), Demyanov and Roshchina (2007), Demyanov and Roshchina (Optimization 55(5---6): 525---540, 2006)). This is why an upper exhauster is called a proper exhauster for minimization problems while a lower exhauster is called a proper one for maximization problems. The results obtained provide a simple geometric interpretation and allow one to construct steepest descent and ascent directions. Until recently, the problem of expressing extremality conditions in terms of adjoint exhausters remained open. Demyanov and Roshchina (Appl Comput Math 4(2): 114---124, 2005), Demyanov and Roshchina (Optimization 55(5---6): 525---540, 2006) was the first to derive such conditions. However, using the conditions obtained (unlike the conditions expressed in terms of proper exhausters) it was not possible to find directions of descent and ascent. In Abbasov (2011) new extremality conditions in terms of adjoint exhausters were discovered. In the present paper, a different proof of these conditions is given and it is shown how to find steepest descent and ascent conditions in terms of adjoint exhausters. The results obtained open the way to constructing numerical methods based on the usage of adjoint exhausters thus avoiding the necessity of converting the adjoint exhauster into a proper one."

This uncertainty is described by a sequence of nested sets (that is, each set contains the previous one), each of which corresponds to a probabilistic guarantee for a different confidence level. Consequently, a set of admissible probability distributions of the unknown parameters is specified. This formulation models the case where the decision maker is aware of and wants to exploit some (yet imprecise) a priori information of the distribution of parameters, and it arises naturally in practice where methods for estimating the confidence region of parameters abound. We propose a decision criterion based on distributional robustness: the optimal strategy maximizes the expected total reward under the most adversarial admissible probability distributions. We show that finding the optimal distributionally robust strategy can be reduced to the standard robust MDP where parameters are known to belong to a single uncertainty set; hence, it can be computed in polynomial time under mild technical conditions."

The entire data is subdivided into many sub-blocks which are treated as independent from each other. The approximate maximum likelihood estimator, called maximum block independent likelihood estimator, is shown to have the same asymptotic distribution as that of the maximum likelihood estimator in the Ising model, a special case of the spatial auto-logistic model. The computational load for the proposed estimator is much lighter than that for the maximum likelihood estimator, and decreases geometrically as the size of a sub-block decreases. Also, limited simulation studies show that, in finite samples, the maximum block independent likelihood estimator performs as well as the maximum likelihood estimator in mean squared error. We apply our procedure to an estimation and a test of spatial dependence in the longleaf pine tree data in Cressie (1993) and the aerial image data in Pyun et al. (2007). Finally, we discuss the extension of the proposed estimator to other spatial auto-regressive models."

One of their strengths is that even high-order methods do not show order reduction in computations for stiff problems. With this property, peer methods commend themselves as time-stepping schemes in finite element calculations for time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs). We have included a class of linearly-implicit two-step peer methods in the finite element software Kardos. There PDEs are solved following the Rothe method, i.e. first discretised in time, leading to linear elliptic problems in each stage of the peer method. We describe the construction of the methods and how they fit into the finite element framework. We also discuss the starting procedure of the two-step scheme and questions of local temporal error control. The implementation is tested for two-step peer methods of orders three to five on a selection of PDE test problems on fixed spatial grids. No order reduction is observed and the two-step methods are more efficient, at least competitive, in comparison with the linearly implicit one-step methods provided in Kardos."

This prior distribution depends on hyper-parameters. It is well-known that the models's posterior distribution is sensitive to the specification of these hyper-parameters and no completely satisfactory method is registered. In order to avoid this problem, we suggest adopting an empirical Bayes strategy, that is a strategy for which the values of the hyper-parameters are determined using the data. Typically, the hyper-parameters are fixed to their maximum likelihood estimations. In order to calculate these maximum likelihood estimations, we suggest a Markov chain Monte Carlo version of the Stochastic Approximation EM algorithm.

A natural explanation for this phenomenon is that the applied mathematical model was not sufficiently realistic and did not fully represent all the decision makers criteria and constraints. Since multicriteria optimization approaches are specifically designed to incorporate such complex preference structures, they gain more and more importance in application areas as, for example, engineering design and capital budgeting. The aim of this paper is to analyze optimization problems both from a constrained programming and a multicriteria programming perspective. It is shown that both formulations share important properties, and that many classical solution approaches have correspondences in the respective models. The analysis naturally leads to a discussion of the applicability of some recent approximation techniques for multicriteria programming problems for the approximation of optimal solutions and of Lagrange multipliers in convex constrained programming.

This mapping is actually defined for ordered oriented matroids. We call it the active orientation-to-basis mapping, in reference to an extensive use of activities, a notion depending on a linear ordering, first introduced by W.T. Tutte for spanning trees in graphs. The active mapping, which preserves activities, can be considered as a bijective generalization of a polynomial identity relating two expressions-one in terms of activities of reorientations, and the other in terms of activities of bases-of the Tutte polynomial of a graph, a hyperplane arrangement or an oriented matroid. Specializations include bijective versions of well-known enumerative results related to the counting of acyclic orientations in graphs or of regions in hyperplane arrangements. Other interesting features of the active mapping are links established between linear programming and the Tutte polynomial. We consider here the bounded case of the active mapping, where bounded corresponds to bipolar orientations in the case of graphs, and refers to bounded regions in the case of real hyperplane arrangements, or of oriented matroids. In terms of activities, this is the uniactive internal case. We introduce fully optimal bases, simply defined in terms of signs, strengthening optimal bases of linear programming. An optimal basis is associated with one flat with a maximality property, whereas a fully optimal basis is equivalent to a complete flag of flats, each with a maximality property. The main results of the paper are that a bounded region has a unique fully optimal basis, and that, up to negating all signs, fully optimal bases provide a bijection between bounded regions and uniactive internal bases. In the bounded case, up to negating all signs, the active mapping is a bijection."

Clique-width is more encompassing in the sense that a graph of bounded treewidth is also of bounded clique-width (but not the converse). For graphs of bounded clique-width, given the clique-width decomposition, every optimization, enumeration or evaluation problem that can be defined by a monadic second-order logic formula using quantifiers on vertices, but not on edges, can be solved in polynomial time. This is reminiscent of the situation for graphs of bounded treewidth, where the same statement holds even if quantifiers are also allowed on edges. Thus, graphs of bounded clique-width are a larger class than graphs of bounded treewidth, on which we can resolve fewer, but still many, optimization problems efficiently. One of the major open questions regarding clique-width is whether graphs of clique-width at most k, for fixed k, can be recognized in polynomial time.

The new tree search management technique results in improved performance across standard solution and computational indicators when compared to previously proposed techniques.

We construct a new smoothing projection operator onto the polyhedral convex set, which is feasible, twice continuously differentiable, uniformly approximate to the projection operator, and satisfies a special approximation property. It is computed by solving nonlinear equations in a neighborhood of the nonsmooth points of the projection operator, and solving linear equations with only finite coefficient matrices for other points, which makes it very efficient. Under the assumption that the variational inequality problem has no solution at infinity, which is a weaker condition than several well-known ones, the existence and global convergence of a smooth homotopy path from almost any starting point in $$R^n$$ are proven. The global convergence condition of the proposed homotopy method is same with that of the homotopy method based on the equivalent KKT system, but the starting point of the proposed homotopy method is not necessarily an interior point, and the efficiency is more higher. Preliminary test results show that the proposed method is practicable, effective and robust."

Recently, it was shown that KBR with a least squares loss function may have some undesirable properties from a robustness point of view: even very small amounts of outliers can dramatically affect the estimates. KBR with other loss functions is more robust, but often gives rise to more complicated computations (e.g. for Huber or logistic losses). In classical statistics robustness is often improved by reweighting the original estimate. In this paper we provide a theoretical framework for reweighted Least Squares KBR (LS-KBR) and analyze its robustness. Some important differences are found with respect to linear regression, indicating that LS-KBR with a bounded kernel is much more suited for reweighting. In two special cases our results can be translated into practical guidelines for a good choice of weights, providing robustness as well as fast convergence. In particular a logistic weight function seems an appropriate choice, not only to downweight outliers, but also to improve performance at heavy tailed distributions. For the latter some heuristic arguments are given comparing concepts from robustness and stability."

We explore extensions of the concepts of these perceptron methods to the general homogeneous conic system Ax ∈ intK, where K is a regular convex cone. We provide a conic extension of the rescaled perceptron algorithm based on the notion of a deep-separation oracle of a cone, which essentially computes a certificate of strong separation. We show that the rescaled perceptron algorithm is theoretically efficient if an efficient deep-separation oracle is available for the feasible region. Furthermore, when K is the cross-product of basic cones that are either half-spaces or second-order cones, then a deep-separation oracle is available and, hence, the rescaled perceptron algorithm is theoretically efficient. When the basic cones of K include semidefinite cones, then a probabilistic deep-separation oracle for K can be constructed that also yields a theoretically efficient version of the rescaled perceptron algorithm."

Firstly, the mathematics models of constrained objective optimization design for encoding problems based on the thermodynamic criteria are set up. Then, a modified IWO method is developed by defining the colonizing behavior of weeds to overcome the obstacles of the original IWO algorithm, which cannot be applied to discrete problems directly. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective and convenient for the user to design and select effective DNA sequences in silicon for controllable DNA computing."

The purpose of this paper is to find a proper convergence-control parameter $c_0$ to get a convergent series solution, or a faster convergent one. This modified approach minimizes the norm of a discrete residual function, systematically, in which seeks to find an optimal value of the convergence-control parameter $c_0$ at each order of HAM approximation, instead of the so-called $c_0$-curve process.

Recently, researchers have found that many physical processes exhibit fractional order behavior that varies with time or space. The continuum of order in the fractional calculus allows the order of the fractional operator to be considered as a variable. In this paper, we consider the mobile-immobile advection-dispersion model with the Coimbra variable time fractional derivative which is preferable for modeling dynamical systems and is more efficient from the numerical standpoint. A novel implicit numerical method for the equation is proposed and the stability of the approximation is investigated. As for the convergence of the numerical method, we only consider a special case, i.e., the time fractional derivative is independent of the time variable t. The case where the time fractional derivative depends on both the time variable t and the space variable x will be considered in a future work. Finally, numerical examples are provided to show that the implicit difference approximation is computationally efficient."

We first introduce a simulation-based method to decompose the multiple nonparametric regression into two parts. The first part can be estimated with the parametric convergence rate and the second part is small enough so that it can be approximated by orthogonal basis functions with a small trade-off parameter. Then the linear combination of the first and second step estimators results in a two-stage estimator for the multiple regression function. Our method does not need any specified structural assumption on the regression function and it is proved that the newly proposed estimation is always consistent even if the trade-off parameter is designed to be small. Thus when the common nonparametric estimator such as local linear smoothing collapses because of the curse of dimensionality, our estimator still works well."

In particular, the case v@?(G)@?2 coincides with the class of path graphs (vertex intersection graphs of paths in trees). We prove for every fixed k=3 that deciding whether the vertex leafage of a given chordal graph is at most k is NP-complete.

We further prove that it is NP-hard to find for a given split graph G (with vertex leafage at most three) a tree model with minimum total number leaves in all subtrees, or where maximum number of subtrees are paths.

One can define convergence in terms of counting homomorphisms from fixed graphs into members of the sequence (left-convergence), or counting homomorphisms into fixed graphs (right-convergence). Under appropriate conditions, these two ways of defining convergence was proved to be equivalent in the dense case by Borgs, Chayes, Lovász, Sós and Vesztergombi. In this paper a similar equivalence is established in the bounded degree case, if the set of graphs in the definition of right-convergence is appropriately restricted. In terms of statistical physics, the implication that left convergence implies right convergence means that for a left-convergent sequence, partition functions of a large class of statistical physics models converge.

Despite previous explanations of IST, this study presents it as a method of constructing a local model to approximate the objective function. It only uses the approximation of the quadratic term while keeping the ℓ1 norm term unchanged. Based on this, we propose a modified IST (MIST), using a general strictly convex quadratic function to approximate the quadratic part. IST uses the identity matrix to approximate the Hessian matrix of the quadratic term, while we adopt an adaptive matrix by using the information of current and former iterates. This strategy results in the two-point step-size IST, including MISTBB1 and MISTBB2.

Interestingly, it was shown recently in Grewenig et al. (2010) that the simple idea of so-called ""superstep cycles"" leads to very efficient schemes for time-dependent (parabolic) image enhancement problems as well as for steady state (elliptic) image compression tasks. The ""superstep cycles"" approach is similar to the nonstationary (cyclic) Richardson method which has been around for over sixty years.In this paper, we investigate the incorporation of superstep cycles into the projected gradient method. We show for two problems in compressive sensing and image processing, namely the LASSO approach and the Rudin-Osher-Fatemi model that the resulting simple cyclic projected gradient algorithm can numerically compare with various state-of-the-art first-order algorithms. However, due to the nonlinear projection within the algorithm convergence proofs even under restrictive assumptions on the linear operators appear to be hard.

Most estimation methodologies developed in the literature, such as the famous partial likelihood based estimation, are built on the ground that the censoring is noninformative. However, in many applications, the censoring is indeed informative. In this paper, we study the survival regression models with an informative censoring that is easy to detect and apply. A very important problem in practice is how to estimate the survival models more efficiently with the information from the informative censoring. We propose a semiparametric maximum likelihood approach that is easily implementable to estimate both the nonparametric baseline hazard and the parametric coefficients in the survival models with informative censoring. Different from the methods in the literature, we do not apply least informative approach to the baseline, which does not work well in our simulation. We solve the difficulty in semiparametric estimation by suggesting an indirect application of local kernel smoothing to the baseline. Asymptotic theory of the proposed estimators is established under informative and noninformative likelihoods, respectively. We suggest a cross-validation method to detect the informative censoring in application. The performances of the estimators in finite samples are investigated by Monte Carlo simulation. Both asymptotic theory and simulation show that the suggested semiparametric approach provides more efficient estimators of the parameters for informative censoring, and estimates the baseline function accurately.

Henning,"University of Johannesburg, South Africa",467,JOURNAL OF COMBINATORIAL OPTIMIZATION,2066935," In this paper we continue the study of Roman dominating functions in graphs. A signed Roman dominating function (SRDF) on a graph G=(V,E) is a function f:V驴{驴1,1,2} satisfying the conditions that (i) the sum of its function values over any closed neighborhood is at least one and (ii) for every vertex u for which f(u)=驴1 is adjacent to at least one vertex v for which f(v)=2. The weight of a SRDF is the sum of its function values over all vertices. The signed Roman domination number of G is the minimum weight of a SRDF in G. We present various lower and upper bounds on the signed Roman domination number of a graph. Let G be a graph of order n and size m with no isolated vertex. We show that $\gamma _{\mathrm{sR}}(G) \ge\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{n} - n$ and that 驴 sR(G)驴(3n驴4m)/2. In both cases, we characterize the graphs achieving equality in these bounds.

One way to choose $$k$$ based on the data is leave-one-out-cross-validation. The selection of the cross-validation criterion is similarly important as the choice of the smoother. Especially, when outliers are present, robust cross-validation criteria are needed. So far little is known about the behaviour of robust cross-validated smoothers in the presence of discontinuities in the regression function. We combine different smoothing procedures based on local constant fits with each of several cross-validation criteria. These combinations are compared in a simulation study under a broad variety of data situations with outliers and abrupt jumps. There is not a single overall best cross-validation criterion, but we find Boente-cross-validation to perform well in case of large percentages of outliers and the Tukey-criterion in case of data situations with jumps, even if the data are contaminated with outliers."

Polynomial tractability means that the solution of a d-variate problem can be solved to within @e with polynomial cost in @e^-^1 and d. Unfortunately, many multivariate problems are not polynomially tractable. This holds for all non-trivial unweighted linear tensor product problems. By an unweighted problem we mean the case when all variables and groups of variables play the same role. It seems natural to ask what is the ''smallest'' non-exponential function T:[1,~)x[1,~)-[1,~) for which we have T-tractability of unweighted linear tensor product problems; that is, when the cost of a multivariate problem can be bounded by a multiple of a power of T(@e^-^1,d). Under natural assumptions, it turns out that this function is T^q^p^o^l(x,y)=exp((1+lnx)(1+lny))for all x,y@?[1,~). The function T^q^p^o^l goes to infinity faster than any polynomial although not ''much'' faster, and that is why we refer to T^q^p^o^l-tractability as quasi-polynomial tractability. The main purpose of this paper is to promote quasi-polynomial tractability, especially for the study of unweighted multivariate problems. We do this for the worst case and randomized settings and for algorithms using arbitrary linear functionals or only function values. We prove relations between quasi-polynomial tractability in these two settings and for the two classes of algorithms."

Our algorithm is motivated by the well-known Direct algorithm which evaluates the objective function on a set of points that tries to cover the most promising subregions of the feasible region. Almost all previous modifications of Direct algorithm use hyper-rectangular partitions. However, other types of partitions may be more suitable for some optimization problems. Simplicial partitions may be preferable when the initial feasible region is either already a simplex or may be covered by one or a manageable number of simplices. Therefore in this paper we propose and investigate simplicial versions of the partition-based algorithm. In the case of simplicial partitions, definition of potentially optimal subregion cannot be the same as in the rectangular version. In this paper we propose and investigate two definitions of potentially optimal simplices: one involves function values at the vertices of the simplex and another uses function value at the centroid of the simplex. We use experimental investigation to compare performance of the algorithms with different definitions of potentially optimal partitions. The experimental investigation shows, that proposed simplicial algorithm gives very competitive results to Direct algorithm using standard test problems and performs particularly well when the search space and the numbers of local and global optimizers may be reduced by taking into account symmetries of the objective function."

The algorithm is a modification to the new version of the Price's algorithm given in Brachetti et al. [J. Global Optim. 10, 165---184 (1997)]. Its distinguishing features include: (1) The number-theoretic method is applied to generate the initial population so that the points in the initial population are uniformly scattered, and therefore the algorithm could explore uniformly the region of interest at the initial iteration; (2) The simplified quadratic approximation with the three best points is employed to improve the local search ability and the accuracy of the minimum function value, and to reduce greatly the computational overhead of the algorithm. Two sets of experiments are carried out to illustrate the efficiency of the number-theoretic method and the simplified quadratic model separately. The proposed algorithm has also been compared with the original one by solving a wide set of benchmark problems. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm requires a smaller number of function evaluations and, in many cases, yields a smaller or more accurate minimum function value.

Zhou,"Lancaster University, UK",703,FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS,1093520," In this paper we present two novel approaches for on-line evolving fuzzy classifiers, called eClass and FLEXFIS-Class. Both methods can be applied with different model architectures, including single model (SM) with class labels as consequents, classification hyper-planes as consequents, and multi-model (MM) architecture. Additionally, eClass can have a multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) architecture with multiple hyper-planes as consequents of each fuzzy rule. The difference between MM and MIMO architectures is that the former one applies one separate and independent fuzzy rule-based (FRB) classifier for each class and is using an indicator labelling scheme, while the latter one applies a single FRB where the rules are MIMO rather than MISO. Both, eClass and FLEXFIS-Class methods are designed to work on a per-sample basis and are thus one-pass, incremental. Additionally, their structure (FRB) is evolving rather than fixed. It adapts their parameters in antecedent and consequent parts with any newly loaded sample. A special emphasis is placed on advanced issues for improving accuracy and robustness, including a thorough comparison between global and local learning of consequent functions, a novel approach for detecting of and reacting on drifts in the data streams and an enhanced outlier treatment strategy.

The shape detection is achieved by maximizing a posterior function that consists of a prior shape probability model and image likelihood function conditioned on shapes. The statistical shape model is built as a result of a learning process based on nonparametric probability estimation in a PCA reduced feature space formed by the Legendre moments of training silhouette images. A greedy strategy is applied to optimize the proposed cost function by iteratively evolving an implicit active contour in the image space and subsequent constrained optimization of the evolved shape in the reduced shape feature space.

In the recent decade, many models and algorithms have been designed to identify communities in a given network, among which there is a class of methods that globally search the best community structure by optimizing some modularity criteria. However, it has been recently revealed that these methods may either fail to find known qualified communities (a phenomenon called resolution limit) or even yield false communities (the misidentification phenomenon) in some networks. In this paper, we propose a new model which is immune to the above phenomena. The model is constructed by restating community identification as a combinatorial optimization problem. It aims to partition a network into as many qualified communities as possible. This model is formulated as a linear integer programming problem and its NP-completeness is proved. A qualified min-cut based bisecting algorithm is designed to solve this model.

Another important strategy for reducing the work in the matrix-vector products is preconditioning the Krylov method by another iterative Krylov method. Flexible Krylov methods are Krylov methods designed for this situation. We combine these two approaches for reducing the work in the matrix-vector products. Specifically, we present strategies for choosing the precision of the matrix-vector products in several flexible Krylov methods as well as for choosing the accuracy of the variable preconditioner such that the overall method is as efficient as possible.

In this article we show that each of these structures has a related, relaxed version, which are also equivalent. Using this, we describe a further structure equivalent to graph limits, namely probability measures on countable graphs that are ergodic with respect to the group of permutations of the nodes. As an application, we prove an analogue of the Positivstellensatz for graphs: we show that every linear inequality between subgraph densities that holds asymptotically for all graphs has a formal proof in the following sense: it can be approximated arbitrarily well by another valid inequality that is a “sum of squares” in the algebra of partially labeled graphs. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We study the first- and second-order optimality conditions of the original StBQP and the reformulated bi-quartic problem over the product of two Euclidean spheres. Furthermore, we discuss the one-to-one correspondence between the global/local solutions of StBQP and the global/local solutions of the reformulation.

In this paper, we prove this conjecture for odd-wheel-free graphs and for ‘triangle-3-colorable’ graphs, where the latter property means that the edges of the graph can be colored with three colors in such a way that each triangle receives three distinct colors on its edges. Among the consequences we obtain that the conjecture holds for every graph with chromatic number at most four.

The Gradual Cover Location Problem (GCLP) was specifically designed to extend the basic cover objective to capture sensitivity with respect to absolute travel distance. The Ordered Median Location problem is a generalization of most of the classical locations problems like p-median or p-center problems. The OGCLP model provides a unifying structure for the standard location models and allows us to develop objectives sensitive to both relative and absolute customer-to-facility distances. We derive Finite Dominating Sets (FDS) for the one facility case of the OGCLP. Moreover, we present efficient algorithms for determining the FDS and also discuss the conditional case where a certain number of facilities is already assumed to exist and one new facility is to be added. For the multi-facility case we are able to identify a finite set of potential facility locations a priori, which essentially converts the network location model into its discrete counterpart. For the multi-facility discrete OGCLP we discuss several Integer Programming formulations and give computational results."

Each supplier's profit depends not only on its own delivery frequency, but also on other suppliers' frequencies through their impact on manufacturer's purchase allocation to the suppliers. We first solve the follower's (manufacturer's) purchase allocation problem by deducing an explicit formula of its solution. We then formulate the n leaders' (suppliers') game as a generalized Nash game with shared constraints, which is theoretically difficult, but in our case could be solved numerically by converting to a regular variational inequality problem.

These approximations are obtained by considering the conditional expectation E[S|@L] of S with respect to a conditioning random variable @L. The choice of @L is crucial in order to obtain accurate approximations. The different alternatives for @L that have been proposed in the literature to date are 'global' in the sense that @L is chosen such that the entire distribution of the approximation E[S|@L] is 'close' to the corresponding distribution of the original sum S. In an actuarial or a financial context one is often only interested in a particular tail of the distribution of S. Therefore in this paper we propose approximations E[S|@L] which are only locally optimal, in the sense that the relevant tail of the distribution of E[S|@L] is an accurate approximation for the corresponding tail of the distribution of S. Numerical illustrations reveal that local optimal choices for @L can improve the quality of the approximations in the relevant tail significantly.

This paper analyzes the importance of the randomness in the PSO, and then gives a PSO variant without randomness to show that traditional PSO cannot work without randomness. Based on our analysis of the randomness, another way of using randomness is proposed in PSO with random dimension selection (PSORDS) algorithm, which utilizes random dimension selection instead of stochastic coefficients. Finally, deterministic methods to do the dimension selection are proposed, and the resultant PSO with distance based dimension selection (PSODDS) algorithm is greatly superior to the traditional PSO and PSO with heuristic dimension selection (PSOHDS) algorithm is comparable to traditional PSO algorithm. In addition, using our dimension selection method to a newly proposed modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO) algorithm also gets improved results.

Subject based as opposed to observation based evaluation of these data results in increased efficiency of the estimation of the misclassification rate. A subject based approach for classification in the generation of bootstrap samples of bagging and bundling methods is analyzed. A simulation model is used to compare the performance of different strategies to create the bootstrap samples which are used to grow individual trees. The proposed approach is compared to linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, random forests and gradient boosting. Finally, the simulation results are applied to glaucoma diagnosis using both eyes of glaucoma patients and healthy controls.

Constraint set is a polyhedral cone and coefficients of the diffusion are governed by, in addition to the system state, a finite-state Markov process that is independent of the driving noise. Such models arise as limit objects in the heavy traffic analysis of generalized Jackson networks (GJN) with Markov-modulated arrival and processing rates. We give sufficient conditions (which, in particular, includes a requirement on the regularity of the underlying Skorohod map) for positive recurrence and geometric ergodicity. When the coefficients only depend on the modulating Markov process (i.e., they are independent of the system state), a complete characterization for stability and transience is provided. The case, where the pathwise Skorohod problem is not well posed but the underlying reflection matrix is completely-S, is treated as well. As consequences of geometric ergodicity various results, such as exponential integrability of invariant measures and central limit results (CLT) for fluctuations of long-time averages of process functionals about their stationary values, are obtained. Conditions for stability are formulated in terms of the averaged drift, where the average is taken with respect to the stationary distribution of the modulating Markov process. Finally, steady-state distributions of the underlying GJN are considered and it is shown that under suitable conditions, such distributions converge to the unique stationary distribution of the constrained random environment diffusion."

For practical applications, it is desirable to be able to increase the total number of sampling points N one or several at a time until a desired accuracy is met, while keeping all existing evaluations. We show that although a convergence rate of order close to 1/N can be achieved for all values of N (e.g., by using a good lattice sequence), it is impossible to get better than order 1/N convergence for all values of N by adding equally-weighted sampling points in this manner.

The systems under study possess unstructured uncertainties, unknown dead-zone, uncertain dynamics and unknown gain functions. In the controller design, fuzzy logic systems are adopted to approximate the unknown functions, and the uncertain nonlinear system is therefore transformed into an uncertain parameterized system with unmodeled dynamics. By combining the backstepping technique with the stochastic small-gain approach, a novel adaptive fuzzy robust control scheme is developed. It is shown that the proposed control approach can guarantee that the closed-loop system is input-state-practically stable (ISpS) in probability, and the output of the system converges to a small neighborhood of the origin by appropriately tuning several design parameters.

Considering a granular knowledge domain consisting of a large number of individual bits and pieces of domain knowledge (properties) and a large number of knowledge sources and services that provide mappings between sets of properties, the objective of the component set identification problem is to select a minimum cost combination of knowledge sources that can provide a joint mapping from a given set of initially available properties (initial knowledge) to a set of initially unknown properties (target knowledge). We position the component set identification problem relative to other combinatorial problems and provide a classification scheme for the different variations of the problem. The problem is next modeled on a directed graph and analyzed in terms of its complexity.

We propose a parametric penalized spline smoothing method, which has the same flexibility as the nonparametric smoothing methods. It also uses the prior knowledge of the underlying function by defining an additional penalty term using the distance of the fitted function to the assumed parametric function.

We give a polynomial-time algorithm for recognising graphs that are both permutation and polar. Prior to our result, polarity has been resolved only for chordal graphs and cographs."

6134,2014.0,Christian Ronse,"University of Strasbourg, France",1202,JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL IMAGING AND VISION,2077675," The refinement order on partitions corresponds to the operation of merging blocks in a partition, which is relevant to image segmentation and filtering methods. Its mathematical extension to partial partitions, that we call standard order, involves several operations, not only merging, but also creating new blocks or inflating existing ones, which are equally relevant to image segmentation and filtering techniques. These three operations correspond to three basic partial orders on partial partitions, the merging, inclusion and inflating orders. There are three possible combinations of these three basic orders, one of them is the standard order, the other two are the merging-inflating and inclusion-inflating orders. We study these orders in detail, giving in particular their minimal and maximal elements, covering relations and height functions. We interpret hierarchies of partitions and partial partitions in terms of an adjunction between (partial) partitions (possibly with connected blocks) and scalars. This gives a lattice-theoretical interpretation of edge saliency, hence a typology for the edges in partial partitions. The use of hierarchies in image filtering, in particular with component trees, is also discussed. Finally, we briefly mention further orders on partial partitions that can be useful for image segmentation."

In this paper, a hybrid ranking approach is presented to estimate vulnerabilities under the dynamic scenarios, which is a combination of low-level rating for vulnerability instances and high-level evaluation for the security level of the network system. Moreover, a novel quantitative model, an adapted attack graph, is also proposed to escaping isolated scoring, which takes the dynamic and logic relations among exploits into account, and significantly benefits to vulnerability analysis. To validate applicability and performance of our approach, a hybrid ranking case is implemented as experimental platform. The ranking results show that our approach differentiates the influential levels among vulnerabilities under dynamic attacking scenarios and economically enhances the security of network system."

In this paper the velocity convergence of particles is first analyzed and the relationship between the velocity of particle and the search failures is pointed out, which reveals the reasons why PSO has relative poor global searching ability. Then this algorithm introduces the velocity information which is defined as the average absolute value of velocity of all the particles. A new strategy is presented that the inertia weight is dynamically adjusted according to average absolute value of velocity which follows a given nonlinear ideal velocity by feedback control, which can avoid the velocity closed to zero at the early stage. Under the guide of the nonlinear ideal velocity, APSO-VI can maintain appropriate swarm diversity and alleviate the premature convergence validly. Numerical experiments are conducted to compare the proposed algorithm with different variants of PSO on some benchmark functions. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm remarkably improves the ability of PSO to jump out of the local optima and significantly enhance the convergence speed and precision."

The major advantage of schemes which are based on trigonometric polynomial spaces is that they can simulate the wave-like and highly oscillatory cases better than the ones based on algebraic polynomial spaces. We provide numerical results in one and two dimensions to illustrate the behavior of these procedures in such cases.

Secondly, we show that modelling an experimenter and experimental procedure algorithmically imposes a limit on our ability to measure resistance by the Wheatstone bridge.The connection between the algorithm and physical test is mediated by a protocol controlling each query, especially the physical time taken by the experimenter.

When multiple replicates of measurements are available for the dynamic process, it is of great interest to estimate mixed-effects in the ODE model for the process. We propose a semiparametric method to estimate mixed-effects ODE models. Rather than using the ODE numeric solution directly, which requires providing initial conditions, this method estimates a spline function to approximate the dynamic process using smoothing splines. A roughness penalty term is defined using the ODEs, which measures the fidelity of the spline function to the ODEs. The smoothing parameter, which controls the trade-off between fitting the data and maintaining fidelity to the ODEs, can be specified by users or selected objectively by generalized cross validation. The spline coefficients, the ODE random effects, and the ODE fixed effects are estimated in three nested levels of optimization. Two simulation studies show that the proposed method obtains good estimates for mixed-effects ODE models. The semiparametric method is demonstrated with an application of a pharmacokinetic model in a study of HIV combination therapy."

This notion was introduced by Erdos, Graham, Montgomery, Rothschild, Spencer and Straus, who asked if a set is Ramsey if and only if it is spherical, meaning that it lies on the surface of a sphere. This question (made into a conjecture by Graham) has dominated subsequent work in Euclidean Ramsey theory. In this paper we introduce a new conjecture regarding which sets are Ramsey; this is the first ever 'rival' conjecture to the conjecture above. Calling a finite set transitive if its symmetry group acts transitively-in other words, if all points of the set look the same-our conjecture is that the Ramsey sets are precisely the transitive sets, together with their subsets. One appealing feature of this conjecture is that it reduces (in one direction) to a purely combinatorial statement. We give this statement as well as several other related conjectures. We also prove the first non-trivial cases of the statement. Curiously, it is far from obvious that our new conjecture is genuinely different from the old. We show that they are indeed different by proving that not every spherical set embeds in a transitive set. This result may be of independent interest."

This set considers the pairs of points at which the bitangent contact occurs. One thus obtains pairwise symmetric points of a 2D shape. A closed 2D shape has a parameterization P with finite length. Its pre-symmetry can therefore be represented by a symmetric diagram curves formed from the pairs of points (p i ,p j )驴S 1脳S 1.We discuss the properties of the pre-symmetry set visualized by this diagram. We firstly give the so-called transitions, changes caused by a perturbation of the shape and show the changes of the curves in the pre-symmetry set diagram. Secondly, we investigate curves that are spanned by all points on the shape. We name the curves essential loops and discuss their properties and transitions. As one important result we show that their are either zero or two essential loops. In the latter case a part of the medial axis is spanned by an essential loop and can therefore be considered as the main axis of the medial axis.As application of pre-symmetry sets, we discuss two possibilities for shape matching based on representations of the pre-symmetry set. The first shape descriptor we present is given by a circular diagram representing the shape, with a set of points representing the extrema of the curvature in the order they appear on the shape. They are pairwise connected and endowed with a length measure. This descriptor is directly related to the curves and their lengths in the pre-symmetry set diagram.

Our algorithm, called Random Walker Termination (RWT), employs a large number of random walkers to capture the structure of a given graph using termination rates in a time sequence. To verify the effectiveness of the RWT algorithm, we use three major graph models, namely, the Erd驴s-Rényi random graphs, the Watts-Strogatz small-world graphs, and the Barabási-Albert preferential-attachment graphs, to generate graphs of different sizes. We show that the RWT algorithm performs well for graphs generated by these models. Our experiment results agree with the actual similarities of generated graphs.

In recent years, splitting methods have been extensively used as geometric numerical integrators showing excellent performances (both qualitatively and quantitatively) when applied on many problems. They are designed for autonomous separable systems, and a substantial number of methods tailored for different structures of the equations have recently appeared. Splitting methods have also been used for separable non-autonomous problems either by solving each non-autonomous part separately or after each vector field is frozen properly. We show that both procedures correspond to introducing the time as two new coordinates. We generalize these results by considering the time as one or more further coordinates which can be integrated following either of the previous two techniques. We show that the performance as well as the order of the final method can strongly depend on the particular choice. We present a simple analysis which, in many relevant cases, allows one to choose the most appropriate split to retain the high performance the methods show on the autonomous problems. This technique is applied to different problems and its performance is illustrated for several numerical examples."

They can deal simultaneously with nonlinear covariate effects and time trends, unit- or cluster-specific heterogeneity, spatial heterogeneity and complex interactions between covariates of different type. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical or multilevel version of regression models with structured additive predictor where the regression coefficients of a particular nonlinear term may obey another regression model with structured additive predictor. In that sense, the model is composed of a hierarchy of complex structured additive regression models. The proposed model may be regarded as an extended version of a multilevel model with nonlinear covariate terms in every level of the hierarchy. The model framework is also the basis for generalized random slope modeling based on multiplicative random effects. Inference is fully Bayesian and based on Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation techniques. We provide an in depth description of several highly efficient sampling schemes that allow to estimate complex models with several hierarchy levels and a large number of observations within a couple of minutes (often even seconds).

Robustness is also an important concept in industrial optimization. Here, robustness means that the responses are not sensitive to the small changes of the input variables. However, most of the recent work in industrial optimization has not dealt with robustness, and most practitioners follow up optimization calculations without consideration for robustness. This paper presents a strategy for dealing with robustness and optimization simultaneously for multiple responses. In this paper, we propose a robustness desirability function distinguished from the optimization desirability function and also propose an overall desirability function approach, which makes balance between robustness and optimization for multiple response problems. Simplex search method is used to search for the most robust optimal point in the feasible operating region. Finally, the proposed strategy is illustrated with an example from the literature.

If the pair obeys the cut condition, then the flow-cut gap for this instance is the minimum value C such that there exists a feasible multiflow for H if each edge of G is given capacity C. It is well known that the flow-cut gap may be greater than 1 even in the case where G is the (series-parallel) graph K""2"",""3. In this paper we are primarily interested in the ''integer'' flow-cut gap. What is the minimum value C such that there exists a feasible integer valued multiflow for H if each edge of G is given capacity C? We formulate a conjecture that states that the integer flow-cut gap is quantitatively related to the fractional flow-cut gap. In particular this strengthens the well-known conjecture that the flow-cut gap in planar and minor-free graphs is O(1) (Gupta et al. (2004) [13]) to suggest that the integer flow-cut gap is O(1). We give several technical tools and results on nontrivial special classes of graphs to give evidence for the conjecture and further explore the ''primal'' method for understanding flow-cut gaps; this is in contrast to and orthogonal to the highly successful metric embeddings approach. Our results include the following:*Let G be obtained by series-parallel operations starting from an edge st, and consider orienting all edges in G in the direction from s to t. A demand is compliant if its endpoints are joined by a directed path in the resulting oriented graph. We show that if the cut condition holds for a compliant instance and G+H is Eulerian, then an integral routing of H exists. This result includes as a special case, routing on a ring but is not a special case of the Okamura-Seymour theorem. *Using the above result, we show that the integer flow-cut gap in series-parallel graphs is 5. We also give an explicit class of routing instances that shows via elementary calculations that the flow-cut gap in series-parallel graphs is at least 2-o(1); this is motivated by and simplifies the proof by Lee and Raghavendra (2007) [15]. *The integer flow-cut gap in k-Outerplanar graphs is c^O^(^k^) for some fixed constant c. *A simple proof that the flow-cut gap is O(logk^@?) where k^@? is the size of a node-cover in H; this was previously shown by Gunluk via a more intricate proof (Gunluk (2007) [12])."

A random signal can then be represented as a sum of such differences, a kind of a multiresolution analysis, each difference representing details relevant at a particular scale or resolution. Bayesian analysis is used to infer which details are credible and which are just artifacts of random variation. The applicability of the method is demonstrated using noisy digital images as well as global temperature change fields produced by numerical climate prediction models."

Wormald,"University of Waterloo, Canada",1737,RANDOM STRUCTURES & ALGORITHMS,1020985," We obtain the asymptotic distribution of the number of copies of a fixed subgraph H in a random d-regular graph, provided H is strictly balanced and d = d(n) is chosen so that the expected number of copies of H tends to infinity (but not too quickly), and the expected number of copies sharing edges with two other copies is bounded. The proof of asymptotic normality of the distribution uses a method of factorial moments for variables with unbounded means that was recently derived by the authors. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

6942,2013.0,Qun Lin,"Chinese Academy of Science, China",1454,ADVANCES IN COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS,1948950," In this paper, the authors use the integral identities of triangular linear elements to prove a uniform optimal-order error estimate for the triangular element solution of two-dimensional time-dependent advection-diffusion equations. Also the authors introduce an interpolation postprocessing operator to get the superconvergence estimate under the 驴 weighted energy norm. The estimates above depend only on the initial and right data but not on the scaling parameter 驴."

6952,2008.0,Chi Wang,"Chinese Academy of Science, China",1454,COMPUTERS & MATHEMATICS WITH APPLICATIONS,1036663, This paper presents a dynamic domain decomposition (D^3) technique for implementing the parallelization of the piecewise parabolic method (PPM) for solving the ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. The key point of D^3 is distributing the work dynamically among processes during the execution of the PPM algorithm. This parallel code utilizes D^3 with a message passing interface (MPI) in order to permit efficient implementation on clusters of distributed memory machines and may also simultaneously exploit threading for multiprocessing shared address space architectures. 3D global MHD simulation results for the Earth's magnetosphere on the massively parallel supercomputers Deepcomp 1800 and 6800 demonstrate the scalability and efficiency of our parallelization strategy.

7002,2014.0,Liang Zhu,"University of British Columbia, Canada",407,COMPUTERS & MATHEMATICS WITH APPLICATIONS,2067473, We prove an a-posteriori error estimate for hp-adaptive discontinuous Galerkin methods for the numerical solution of convection-diffusion equations on anisotropically refined rectangular elements. The estimate yields global upper and lower bounds of the errors measured in terms of a natural norm associated with diffusion and a semi-norm associated with convection. The anisotropy of the underlying meshes is incorporated in the upper bound through an alignment measure. We present a series of numerical experiments to test the feasibility of this approach within a fully automated hp-adaptive refinement algorithm.
